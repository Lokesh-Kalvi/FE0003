  <!-- Iteration 5.1: Give an appropriate opening tag for the block element -->
  <p>
    The concept of 'peace' is defined and understood in various ways.
    Understanding peace as absence of violence is a limited vision.
    Peace encompasses happiness and harmony among living beings.
    In a wider understanding, peace is the nature and goal of every sentient being.
    <!-- Iteration 6: wrap "money", "you", "make" individually with <em> tag to make them as a inline element -->
    No matter how much <em>money</em><em>you</em><em>make</em>, a bigger house, a nicer car,
    or more expensive clothing won't give you peace of mind.
    Expecting material possessions to satisfy your needs will leave you
    sorely disappointed. Mentally strong people aren't necessarily minimalists,
    however. They can enjoy nice things. But they don't expect their material possessions
    to give them joy and contentment.

  <h2 class="edit">Short-term politics</h2>
  <p>
    "Many of today's world leaders have great courage: the courage to do harm.
    They are ill-advised, too clever, or too skillful. I think bad political systems,
    by which I mean systems that are not founded on a desire for justice, are mainly due to a
    type of short-sightedness. When politicians see things only in the
    short-term they inevitably only see the short-term gains.
    That is how they develop the type of courage that is necessary to harm others."

    Nations are     far    more        interdependent        than before.
    Our generation has reached the threshold of a new era of human history: the birth of a
    global family. Whether we like it or not, all the members of our vast and
    varied human family have to learn to live together somehow.
    We need to develop a greater sense of universal responsibility,
    on both the individual and collective level."

    By adopting an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altruism" title="The wikipedia Homepage">altruistic</a> outlook and by treating others in the way they deserve,
    our own happiness is assured as a byproduct. We should realize that self-centeredness
